# ProcessModels
These process models were developed by Murthy Lab over years to perform techno-economic analysis of biofuels and bioproducts. 
These models can be opened using Super Pro trial versions. 

# Models ProcessFlow_50
simulates a hypothetical plant producing biodegradable plastic, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate from genetically modified hybrid poplar tree leaves. For details, please see our publication: 
Hohenschuh, W., Kumar, D. and Murthy, G.S.* 2014. Economic and cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate production from plastic producing, genetically modified hybrid poplar leaves. J. Ren. Sust. Energy 6:063113

# Models EtOH_*
simulate impact of various pretreatments on the process economics. For details, pelase refer to our two publications: 

Kumar, D. and Murthy, G.S.* 2011. Impact of pretreatment and downstream processing technologies on economics, energy and water use in cellulosic ethanol production. Biotechnol. Biofuels 4:27 doi:10.1186/1754-6834-4-27

How to open Superpro files?
•	Superpro Designer is a process simulation application from Intelligen Inc., USA. This study used version 8.5 (Commercial License). A license is generally required for modifying the files, while for accessing the information a demo version could be used. 
•	It is essential to check the version compatibility before use as the company releases latest versions. 
•	Superpro is widely used in several industries and universities around the globe for different applications including energy, environment, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products. 
•	To access the demo version, please click this link http://www.intelligen.com/downloads.html. Once some basic information’s are filled out, the demo version could be downloaded. 
•	After installation, Open the Superpro Designer application installed on your computer. To open the Superpro file, Hit File>Open>Location of the file. The Superpro file has an extension of .SPF.
•	To access stream level information, right click on any stream and press simulation data. 
•	To run the simulation, Press F9. It should indicate a message “mass and energy balance solved successfully”.
•	After that go to report>economic evaluation reports. This will provide detailed economic evaluation report. Other reports could also be produced such as cash flow analysis, itemized cost reports etc. 
•	Each unit operation data, can be accessed by right clicking the file and hit operation data. 
•	More tutorials on Superpro Designer could be obtained from https://www.youtube.com/user/IntelligenInc.
