# ProcessModels
These process models were developed by Murthy Lab over years to perform techno-economic analysis of biofuels and bioproducts. 
These models can be opened using Super Pro trial versions. We believe in making our models accessible to everyone to advance science, increase transparency and reproducibility of research. We hope you find our efforts useful!

# Models ProcessFlow_50
simulates a hypothetical plant producing biodegradable plastic, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate from genetically modified hybrid poplar tree leaves. For details, please see our publication: 

Hohenschuh, W., Kumar, D. and Murthy, G.S.* 2014. Economic and cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate production from plastic producing, genetically modified hybrid poplar leaves. J. Ren. Sust. Energy 6:063113

# Models EtOH_*
simulate impact of various pretreatments on the process economics. For details, pelase refer to our two publications: 

Kumar, D. and Murthy, G.S.* 2011. Impact of pretreatment and downstream processing technologies on economics, energy and water use in cellulosic ethanol production. Biotechnol. Biofuels 4:27 doi:10.1186/1754-6834-4-27

# How to open Superpro files?
These instructions to open SuperPro files are  taken from our publication Rajendran and Murthy, 2017 mentioned above. 
"
1. Superpro Designer is a process simulation application from Intelligen Inc., USA. This study used version 8.5 (Commercial License). A license is generally required for modifying the files, while for accessing the information a demo version could be used. 
2. It is essential to check the version compatibility before use as the company releases latest versions. 
3. Superpro is widely used in several industries and universities around the globe for different applications including energy, environment, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products. 
4. To access the demo version, please click this link http://www.intelligen.com/downloads.html. Once some basic information’s are filled out, the demo version could be downloaded. 
5. After installation, Open the Superpro Designer application installed on your computer. To open the Superpro file, Hit File>Open>Location of the file. The Superpro file has an extension of .SPF.
6. To access stream level information, right click on any stream and press simulation data. 
7. To run the simulation, Press F9. It should indicate a message “mass and energy balance solved successfully”.
8. After that go to report>economic evaluation reports. This will provide detailed economic evaluation report. Other reports could also be produced such as cash flow analysis, itemized cost reports etc. 
9. Each unit operation data, can be accessed by right clicking the file and hit operation data. 
10. More tutorials on Superpro Designer could be obtained from https://www.youtube.com/user/IntelligenInc.
